# What is Docker
Docker is an open source platform where a developer can develop and run applications. The main advantage of Docker is that it reduces the time required to develop the software.
Docker provides developer a space called as container where the developer can run and test the application. The developer can have multiple containers and can use them simultaneously to run the applications.
Use the docker container to:
- Develop your application
- Distibute and test the application
- Deploy the application in the production

The developer can use the docker for fast and consistent delivery of the application
